Xanthid - an X11 window manager based on TinyWM
===============================================

hello friends!
this is a stupid dumb bad project im working on. i want to make an actual window manager written in c, and i think that tinywm is a great start. for love of the original project, this will also be within the public domain. enjoy whatever code is written and use it for whatever you want.
