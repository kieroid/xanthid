Xanthid - an X11 window manager based on TinyWM
===============================================

hi thanks for reading this. this is a window manager im developing. it is based on tinywm which is made by nick welch.
im making it public domain (for now) until i achieve something that is usable. 
for right now, this is primary nicks work, so he should get the recognition he deserves.

> [!CAUTION]
> From wikipedia: 
> *"Xanthid crabs are often brightly coloured and are highly poisonous, containing toxins which are not destroyed by cooking and for which no antidote is known."*

> **The joke?** Xanthid is my first window manager. It will likely be very bad for your computer (just as Xanthid crabs are for you.)
